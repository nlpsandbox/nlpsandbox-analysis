# Setup

### Data node instance

This section assumes that you have access to an NLP Sandbox Data Node instance.
Please update the data node configuration in the code block below (IP address
and port, see section Configuration below).

If you don't have access to a data node instance, follow the instruction given
in the following GitHub repository to deploy a local instance using Docker. By
default, the instance will be accessible from your browser at the address
`localhost:8080`.

https://github.com/nlpsandbox/data-node

If you are running this notebook inside a Docker container and are running a
data node locally, note that specifying `localhost` in the configuration below
will refer to the local network of your RStudio container and not your computer
local network. In order to enable this notebook to connect to your local data
node instance, you need to given the RStudio container access to the Docker
network of your data node instance.

1. Find the name of the Docker network of your data node
   (default: `data-node_default`).
2. Update the content of the file `docker-compose.yml` that you use to run this
   RStudio container to include network information as shown below.

```
version: "3.8"

services:
  rstudio:
    image: nlpsandbox/nlpsandbox-analysis:edge
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: nlpsandbox-analysis
    command: rstudio
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - .:/home/rstudio/nlpsandbox:rw
    networks:
      - data-node
    ports:
      - "${HOST_PORT}:8787"

networks:
  data-node:
    external: true
    name: data-node_default
```

3. Restart the RStudio container.
4. This notebook should now be able to access your local data node instance at
   the address `http://data-node:8080/api/v1` where `data-node` should be left
   as-is (name of the data node service defined in the data node
   `docker-compose.yml`).


### Conda environments

List the Conda environments.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
options(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)

conda_list(conda = "auto")
```

Activate the environment `nlpsandbox`.

```{r}
use_condaenv("nlpsandbox", required = TRUE)
```



### Configuration

```{python}
data_node_host = "http://data-node:8080/api/v1"
```




# Datasets

### List datasets

```{python}
from nlpsandboxclient import client

datasets = client.list_datasets(host=data_node_host)

for dataset in datasets:
  print(dataset)

```
